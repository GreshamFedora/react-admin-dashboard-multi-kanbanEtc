E-Commersopolis - Admin Dashboard

This admin dashboard ensconces a number of tools (e.g. Kanban board and searchable employee database) to facilitate admin use and charts that aim to provide insight into various topics using multiple means of visualizations. This project stemmed from a desire to experiment with kanban boards and quickly became a hydra of sorts.

How It's Made:

Tech used: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, & JavaScript

I love kanban boards and so there was a desire to create a project that included one. This led to looking into syncfusion and the incorporation of a kanban board which in turn led to the incorporation of multiple other tools/features and eventually to the admin dashboard that it now is.

Optimizations to do:
-Fix minor bug with menus

Lessons Learned:
Off the shelf solutions always present their own challenges, but it is great to see how they can facilitate the creation of projects such as this dashboard.
